            # Or just the image
            $m->create_imagefile;

            index

DESCRIPTION
    Plots points defined by latitude/longitude on JPEG
    Mercator Projection  maps, optionally creating an HTML
    page with image map to display the image.

DISTRIBUTION CONTENTS
    In addition to this file, the distribution uses the
    included files for default settings: they should be
    placed in the same directory as the module itself only
    if you wish to use default settings.

            .earth.dat
            london_postcodes.jpg
            uk.jpg
            world.jpg

    And some other world images to replace world.jpg, if you
    so choose.

EXPORTS
    None.


NOTES ON LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE
    After http://www.mapblast.com/myblast/helpFaq.mb#2:

        Zero degrees latitude is the equator, with the North
        pole at 90 degrees latitude and the South pole at
        -90 degrees latitude. one degree is approximately 69
        miles. Greenwich, England is at 51.466 degrees north
        of the equator.

        Zero degrees longitude goes through Greenwich,
        England. Again, Each 69 miles from this meridian
        represents approximately 1 degree of longitude.
        East/West is plus/minus respectively.

    Actually, latitude and longitude vary depending upon the
    degree in hand: see The Compton Encyclopdedia for more
    information.

CAVEATS
    The exmaple map, london_postcodes.jpg, is inaccurate.

    Whilst degrees of latitude are accurate to two decimal
    places, Degrees of longitude are taken to be 69 miles:
    this isn't quite right - see the NOTES ON LATITUDE AND
    LONGITUDE entry elsewhere in this document. This will be
    adjusted in a later version.

    All images must be JPEGs - PNG or other support could
    easily be added.

REVSIONS
    1.2 Corrected a slight mis-positioning of points.

        Replaced GD with Image::Magick as I was seeing
        terrible JPEG output
        with GD.

        Replaced support for non-maintained
        "Image::GD::Thumbnail" with "Image::Thumbnail";
        evaluate a require of this at run time rather than
        using the apparently still shakey pragmas.

        Added methods to create just images and to return
        references to image blobs.

    1.0 Don't remember.

    0.25
        Clean IMG path and double-header bugs

    0.23
        Added more documentation; escaping of href text

    0.22
        Added thumbnail images to index page
